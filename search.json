    "text": "General Course Policies\n\nCLASS PREPARATION: Classes are designed to supplement the reading materials (textbooks, course slides, and required readings). Therefore, lectures will not necessarily address the text directly and may not cover all the details in the reading materials. Students must read assigned materials as part of the learning effort. Reading the assigned materials is a good way to cultivate your critical thinking ability and help better follow lectures. Bottom line: Read course slides and required readings.\nPARTICIPATION: Participation in classes is expected for all students, and a lack of participation will impact the grade (see evaluation). Students need to inform the instructor before the class about any anticipated excused absences. See the university attendance guidelines for the definition of excused absences.\nLATE SUBMISSIONS: DO NOT wait until the last minute to submit your assignments as it is always possible to encounter network or computer problems. You do have a grace period of TWO day for late submissions without any penalties, any late work after the grace period won’t be accepted. Please come to my office hour if you need help on lectures, assignments etc.\nWRITING: Professional writing is expected for all assignments, tests, or presentations. You can utilize the writing center if you need assistance. Grammarly and any other similar tools are recommended.\nCOMMUNICATION: Course communication will be done through Canvas and/or email. Be sure to check both regularly for announcements, updates, etc. You are responsible for any content provided. Students need to inform the instructor before the class about any anticipated excused absences. See the university attendance guidelines for the definition of excused absences. Leaving the lecture early without permission is automatically an unexcused absence. While I check my email regularly, do not expect as quick a response past 10 pm during the week or on weekends. I will do my best to respond to emails within 24 hours during the week, and within 48 hours on the weekend.\nEMAIL CONVENTIONS: Please put the course name and code in the email subject. Any email without a formal and proper subject may automatically be directed to spam or trash.\nEXAM DATES: Please plan your travel arrangements carefully to avoid conflicts with exam dates. If you have unavoidable commitments that necessitate taking exams on different dates, please inform me well in advance. Note that such accommodations will be considered on a case-by-case basis and are not guaranteed.",

It is further recommended that after the class or before the next class you review the previous lecture, work on any assigned problems, and bring any questions you may have. Repetition is important in this type of course. Reading the materials prior to class will assist you in understanding the lecture and the class exercises. You also need to write your own answers. Last-minute cramming for the exams tends to result in lack of understanding and a lackluster performance. The final course grade will be calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nParticipation/Notes Submissions\n1% * 14 = 14%\n\n\nMini Essays\n2% * 6 = 12%\n\n\nClass Project\n8%\n\n\nExam 01\n15%\n\n\nExam 02\n15%\n\n\nExam 03\n15%\n\n\n7 Homeworks\n3% * 7 = 21%",

A calculator is allowed as well.\n\n\nHomework & Mini-Essays\nThere will be 7 homework, and 6 300-word mini essays in this course. Mini-essays are designed to help you understand cutting-edge business models and prepare to ace job interviews in the future. There will be a few random quizzes and other in-class activities in this course. In-class activities are designed to help you learn the material, and you are encouraged to complete them.\nHomework assignments are posted on Canvas and should be legible, complete, and typed. Computational steps and details must be shown to earn full credits. Homework assignments are to be turned in at 11:59 PM on their due dates. You are allowed a grace period of two day for late submissions, but any late submissions after that will not be accepted.\nIf there are extreme circumstances which prevent you from completing the assignment on time, please email me before the due date. Please familiarize yourself with the Canvas system early in the semester. If you are not sure if an assignment has submitted correctly, you may email me with your attached homework as proof that it has been completed by the deadline.\n\n\nIn-Class Participation and Attendance\nThe attendance portion of the grade is made up of several components:\n\nBeing physically present in class.\nNot distracting others while in class. This extends to other students. If your behavior impedes the learning environment of other students, you may be asked to leave the classroom and it will be reflected in your grade.\nCompletion of assigned coursework, including in-class activities, notes submissions and in-class quizzes.\n\nIn-Class Participation is essential for students’ engagement and learning experience. Following University policy, students with 4 or more absences may be dropped from the course before the withdrawal deadline or get an F for the final grade according to the University policies listed under the Course of Study Bulletin or may see their final grade affected.\nIn specific, you will need to complete the following task to earn the credits for In-Class Participation/Attendance: - Submit your notes via Canvas at the end of the day of each lecture. The format of the notes doesn’t matter, the submission is counted as your attendance. If you can’t make it to the class due to unavoidable reasons, please do NOT make any submissions.\n\n\nExaminations\nTHREE examinations will be given to evaluate your knowledge of the topics covered in lectures, readings, and assignments, as well as the ability to interpret results. Make-up exams will not be offered unless the absence is for a university sanctioned event (excuse notes must be received before semester examinations) or the instructors deem that the absence was permissible due to extreme extenuating circumstances.\nAccommodated testing can be taken in the Accommodated Testing Center between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. on the exam dates. You must utilize the testing center if you want any allotted extra time for your exams. Students are responsible for scheduling their exams with the ATC. Students must take exams at the ATC on or before the scheduled exam dates.\n\n\nAccommodations\nTrinity University is committed to providing equal access and equal opportunity to students with disabilities. As a sign of that commitment, the office of Student Accessibility Services (SAS) is to assist students who seek accommodations.
